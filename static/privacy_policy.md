## 1. Cookies

We do not use third-party cookies on our website. The only cookies we use
are session cookies, which are essential for security and enabling user
registration, and — in case you select "Remember me" during log in — a
cookie to keep you logged in. Session cookies are temporary and are
automatically deleted when you close your browser.

## 2. User Data Tracking

We do not track user data for analysis or to sell it to third parties. Our
focus is on providing a secure and seamless experience for our users without
compromising their privacy.

## 3. Hosting

Our website is hosted on Heroku, a cloud platform. While Heroku provides the
infrastructure, we do not share your personal information with Heroku, other
than storing your email address in the database.

## 4. Email Addresses

To enable registration on our website, we store users' email addresses in
our database. We take measures to secure this information and ensure it is
used only for the purpose of facilitating your registration and related
communications.

## 5. Email Communication

We use Mailgun, a third-party service, to send emails for registration
purposes. Your email address is shared with Mailgun solely for the purpose
of delivering these registration-related communications.

## 6. Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. We employ industry-standard
measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration, and destruction.

## 7. Data Access and Control

You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information.
